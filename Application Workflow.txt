Application Workflow
User opens index.html → Enters login credentials.
login.js checks login → If correct, redirects to landingPage.html.
User uploads a PDF file → landingPage.js sends it to /upload (scanpro.py).
scanpro.py extracts text → Sends it to OpenAI API.
OpenAI API returns deficiencies & recommendations.
Response is displayed as a card UI on landingPage.html.
