# DriveWise
### **Project Proposal: Drive-Wise**  

**Drive-Wise** is an AI-powered traffic monitoring system designed to **detect and penalize traffic signal violations automatically**. When a vehicle **jumps a red light or stops in a restricted zone**, the system captures an image of its **number plate**, extracts the text using **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**, and **issues a fine** if a violation is found.  

Built with **Spring Boot** and integrated with **AI models**, Drive-Wise ensures **real-time monitoring and automated enforcement**. Traffic authorities can use a **web dashboard** to review violations and track penalties. This system **reduces manual effort, enhances road safety, and promotes disciplined driving**.
